<h2>What is Futarchio?</h2>
<p>
Futarchio is a platform for voting and making predictions, essentially implementing the two major components in a government system called a Futocracy. We believe we can completely disrupt the way politics is made today by predicting the outcomes of legislation and evuating their success. This makes it easier for voters to elect their leaders on the merit of their proposals instead of election promises. And ultimately to vote for values and have the best proposal for those values be evaluated by a market.
