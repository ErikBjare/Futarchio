<h2>What is Futarchio?</h2>
<p>
    Futarchio <i>[Fute - r - kio]</i> is a platform where you can vote for your values and make predictions based on your beliefs. This effectively implements the two major components in a system of government called a Futocracy, where you <i>"Vote on values, but bet beliefs"</i>. We believe this can be a useful tool for every democracy in the world by doing the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Let people vote on their values instead of politicians.</li>
    <li>Let people predict the outcomes of reforms and policies according to their beliefs.</li>
    <li>Let the votes and predictions be indicators for which reforms and policies to implement.</li>
  </ol>
