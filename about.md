### Goal
 - To resolve the poorly optimized political climate, what makes politicians win elections is not good proposals that work, but *promise* of good proposals. 
 You know see that there is an conflict in knowledge, leaders which are better at winning elections than doing what the people wants in the most optimal way possible.
 But who really have the best proposals? 
 And what are the values we have how should they be prioritized? Questions like these are the right ones. There might be nothing horribly *wrong* with politics today, but it is horribly inefficient.

### The name
Our name, We Are People, comes from several things:
 - The Declaration of Independence, famously starting off with "We The People", a conjunction of words which we feel goes in the same spirit as we running this site.
 - That we _all_ are people, and are either bound for greatness or destruction, without cooperation, it will probably turn out for the worse sooner or later.
